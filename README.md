baby steps
I've got a feeling of pre-nostalgia that is almost deafening. I know that, if I keep at this, I'll one day be able to look back on these first steps and feel horribly embarrassed by myself, kinda the way I look back on teenagerdom. When I think about it, it's kind of a blessing that kids don't understand this, or too many would be afraid to make mistakes they'll grimace at later to do much of anything at all. Hell with it, here I go.
